 Applying Blockchain :
 
  With this technology we can have the Rent commission, the landlords, the tenants and GRA as well as the rent control(court in charge of rent problems.) having all these facilities on a single distributed network will decrease the risk of corruption on a whole other level. all stakeholderrs will equally have access to the same information.
